## About this book

In short, this is a middle-to-high level algorithm book designed with cracking coding interviews at hearts. It offers a one-stop coding interview prep experience. The structure of the book: 
* **Preparation**: introduce the global picture of algorithmic problem solving and coding interviews, learn abstract data structures and highly related and useful math such as recurrence relation, and hands-on Python practice by relating the abstract data structures to Python data structures. *Coding is not just code after all.*, 
* **Principles**: we organize the design and principle here so that readers can use them as guidance while not seeking for peculiar algorithm for solving a problem. 
* **Classical algorithms**: We enhance our algorithm database via learning how to apply the core principles to a variety of classical problems. A database that we can quickly relate to when seeing problems.
* **Coding interview problem patterns**:  We close our book with the analyzing and categorizing problems by patterns. We address classical and best solutions for each problem pattern. 



Besides trying to make the content easy to follow, here summarizes the uniqueness of this book: (1) it offers Python source code that is tailored to be simple so that it would be natural for you to use in interviews (2) all the exercises and examples are from Leetcode problems so that you get to practise online (3) Classical algorithms are explained with design principles. No algorithm is magic. (Check out [advanced graph algorithms](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving/blob/master/chapters_pdf/chapter_advanced_graph_algorithm.pdf) as an example) (4) problem patterns to help you tackle coding interview questions topic by topic.

## How did I come up with this book?
Preparing for the coding interview is not easy! Cracking the coding interview? Nearly impossible for most of us! Luck does play a role in the outcome. So, let's just treat it as a learning process and have some fun!

Computer Science is really not just computer science. It is a combination of all fields; our normal interview problems fall into the enumerative combinatorics and our computer vision mostly consists of Linear Algebra. What really matters is our passion to learn and the ability to apply this knowledge to solve real-life problems. 

There are plenty of books out there focusing on either teaching algorithmic knowledge  (*Introduction to Algorithms*, *Algorithmic Problem Solving*, etc) or introducing the interview process and solving interview problems(*Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Coding Interview Questions*, etc), but none of these books truly combine the two. This is a book designed to make up this role in the categorization. Principle, Pattern, and Leetcode Problems make up the core of this book.

This is **NOT** a book that provides hiring statistics for each company or gives the reader quick tricks in order to pass a few coding interviews.  Its purpose is to show you the beauty of algorithmic problem solving in the hope that you will be more passionate and confident about software engineering; the interview questions just set up a playground where we strengthen what we learn.
